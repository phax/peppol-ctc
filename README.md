Peppol CTC specific components.

**This repository is work in progress**

Peppol is an international e-Delivery network.
CTC is the abbreviation for "Continuous Transaction Controls" and is a generic term that describes digital control mechanisms used by tax authorities to collect transactional invoice data in real, or near-real time, so that tax receipts can be matched to business activity.

This repository will offer supporting libraries to
* Create Peppol CTC documents from UBL Invoice and UBL CreditNotes
* Provide validation artefacts for validating Peppol CTC documents, using the [PHIVE](https://github.com/phax/phive) engine
